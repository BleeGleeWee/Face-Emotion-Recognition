# 🧠 Image Classification with Keras & TensorFlow

This repository contains a deep learning project built with **Keras** and **TensorFlow** for image classification.  
The model is trained using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a custom dataset and demonstrates the full workflow of preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model.

---

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation  
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built with Keras  
- Training loop with validation monitoring  
- Checkpoint saving & early stopping  
- Accuracy and loss visualization  
- Easily extendable for other datasets

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BleeGleeWee/Face-Emotion-Recognition.git
   cd Face-Emotion-Recognition


2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Place your dataset inside the `data/` folder.

   * Training and validation data should be structured as:

     ```
     data/
       train/
         class1/
         class2/
         ...
       val/
         class1/
         class2/
         ...
     ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook trainFERmodel.ipynb
   ```

3. Run all cells to train the model.
